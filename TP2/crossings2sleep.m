function [time_sleep,mysleeprec] = crossings2sleep(times, crossings)
 %takes as input the measurement times and whether or not there was 
 %a crossing detected and returns, for each 1/2 hour (30 minute) 
 %interval, the amount of sleep that occurred in that interval. 
 %It returns, in the first output argument, a list of the center 
 %time of the 1/2 hour intervals (in units of hours) and, in the 
 %second output argument, the amount of sleep that occurred during 
 %each interval
